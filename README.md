Case Study:
An insurance company X has been doing the process of getting customers for their Insurance Company manually. They would normally find people who would want an insurance, then an insurance agent would go to their house to help them fill their forms and apply insurance for them. However, after digitalization, the company realized how much money can be saved by having a feature in their existing system (website) for the users to apply for insurance themselves. Your job is to facilitate and prepare the required documents.
